## Local development

You will need a Twilio account. Use [this link](www.twilio.com/referral/vUEkby) to sign up and get `$10` free credit.

Twilio Go is free, but you can use that credit for other twilio services.

You will also need a MongoDB database for storage. You can either have a local MongoDB server or use [MongoDB Altas](https://cloud.mongodb.com) to get a free MongoDB database in the cloud.

- Clone this repository.

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and add the variables as described in the file.
